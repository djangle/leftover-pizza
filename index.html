      <h2>Tripping the fantastic mundane.</h2>

      <p>
        Right now, in our galaxy and others not so different... You occupy
        something sci-fi, quarters of a space station? ship? Your home is a
        single 3D wall, how high does it go? Large windows of the galaxy,
        obscured by space junk; books, goggles, a cornucopia of interstellar
        goods. You see a ladder, impassable at the moment, a screen with a
        flashing green light, and what looks like your bunk covered in blankets
        and bedsheets (clothes?) Moving to one side of the room presents you
        with the option of moving to the Lintel. The Lintel move matter between
        eachother at great distances. You don't know anything else, and you only
        use it as directed by your screen. Do you have room/shipmates? You find
        you are the current occupant-- junk from other "guards" (custodians?)
        litter your bedroom. The screen directs you the Lintel, and the Lintel
        brings you anywhere, anytime, in any of the verses throughout the
        multiverse. The road... transhallucinagenic jazz. Anything can happen.
        Anything can be. Where to start?

      <h2>Living in the present, stuck in the past.</h2>
      <p>
        Surrounded with artifacts from the past, you cannot move forward.
        Removing some of the junk through missions helps you open opportunities
        to progress.
